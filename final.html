        <h1>Adopt A Pet!</h1>
        <p>Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?
<br>Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is 
quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten. Best of all, there are so many benefits 
when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable 
than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or finding a kitten for sale from a litter. There are more benefits as 
well. Since pets in rescues and shelters usually come from a home where the owners ran out of money, got divorced, 
or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs and cats on our website are already housetrained, good with kids, 
or do well with other pets. People are finding out that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder isn't all it's cracked 
up to be and the stress of training a puppy is too much these days. Best of all, rescues care for their animals, and
the dogs and cats don't leave the organization without having their shots and being taken to the vet. That means 
less stress, and more savings! So what are you waiting for? Go find that perfect pet!</p>

        <h2>Adopt Now</h2>
        <p>Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, did we just say 
        personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family should start
        with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do you need a dog that is low key and good
        with kids, or are you looking for an energetic pal who is into trail running? Perhaps a cat that will get 
        along well with others is what you need. The dog rescues and cat rescues that post hundreds of local pets 
        near you are experts at matching you with a dog or cat who will love the life you can provide. This is why 
        so many people are realizing focusing on dog adoption and cat adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet search 
        process. Best of all, our website has a feature called "New Pet Alerts." Simply tell us what you are looking 
        for and we will e-mail you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've made the commitment to adopt 
        a puppy or adopt a kitten, we will e-mail you immediately when we know of a local little furry fellow who is 
        in need of a new home!</p>

			<h3>Adopt by Age</h3>
			<p>Getting ready to adopt a new puppy? Adopt-a-Pet.com’s “The Puppy Manual” is not a 
			complete guide to raising a puppy – there are entire books devoted to that topic! However
			it is a super-helpful and concise 21 pages covering the basics, to help you prepare for the 
			arrival and first few months with your new puppy.  The basic training, socialization, and 
			guidelines explained simply with many easy-to-follow steps can be used starting at the age 
			of 8 weeks, the earliest age at which most people would be bringing a puppy into their home. 
			If your puppy is slightly older, as long as they are under 6 months old, these steps can 
			still be helpful! For puppies older than 6 months, many of these tips still apply, but 
			you’ll want to look at the other articles we have in our blog that are for older puppy & dogs
			too. We have several formats of The Puppy Manual for you to choose from</p>

			<h3>Adopt by Breed</h3>
			<p>If you're just starting your search, you may be asking yourself what kind of dog or cat 
			would be best for your lifestyle. You may be diligently researching the characteristics of 
			each breed, making a list of which breeds would and wouldn't be a fit. To you, we say: 
			Relax! It's okay to do your research, but don't feel like breed selection is the ultimate 
			key to finding your perfect match. It really is about much more than what looks good on 
			paper:	it's about the individual dog or cat's personality and the chemistry you feel 
			together (yep, we have chemistry with animals just like we do with other humans!). And 
			don't forget about those marvelous mutts! Not only do you get a one-of-a-kind companion, 
			but many veterinarians say that mixed-breed dogs tend to be healthier than purebred dogs, 
			who tend to be prone to certain genetic conditions, depending on the breed.</p>

	<h2>Our History</h2>
	<p>In 1961, a limited number of organizations around the world—such as the International Union for the 
	Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and The Conservation Foundation—were trying to meet 
	conservation needs, but were desperately short of funds. The first call for broad support was the Morges
	Manifesto, signed in 1961 by 16 of the world’s leading conservationists, including biologist and African 
	wildlife enthusiast Sir Julian Huxley, IUCN vice president Sir Peter Scott and director-general of the 
	British Nature Conservancy E. M. Nicholson. The Morges Manifesto stated that while the expertise to protect 
	the world environment existed, the financial support to achieve this protection did not. The decision was 
	made to establish World Wildlife Fund as an international fundraising organization to work in collaboration 
	with existing conservation groups and bring substantial financial support to the conservation movement on a 
	worldwide scale.</p>

	<h2>In Loving Memory</h2>
	<p>In 2006, a helicopter carrying WWF staff members Dr. Chandra Gurung, Dr. Harka Gurung, 
	Jennifer Headley, Yeshi Choden Lama, Matthew Preece, Dr. Jillian Bowling Schlaepfer and Mingma Sherpa as
	well as other conservation leaders crashed in Nepal, killing all 23 passengers on board.</p>
