        <h1>Adopt A Pet</h1>
        <p>Have you addressed what type of pet personality you are looking for? Wait a second, did we just say 
        personality, and not breed? Yes, that is right. Finding the ideal pet for yourself or family should start
        with an understanding of the ideal pet personality. Consider this, do you need a dog that is low key and
        good with kids, or are you looking for an energetic pal who is into trail running? Perhaps a cat that will
        get along well with others is what you need. The dog rescues and cat rescues that post hundreds of local pets
        near you are experts at matching you with a dog or cat who will love the life you can provide. This is why 
        so many people are realizing focusing on dog adoption and cat adoption from a rescue is the ideal pet search
        process. Best of all, our website has a feature called "New Pet Alerts." Simply tell us what you are looking
        for and we will e-mail you when that perfect pet is available! So even if you've made the commitment to adopt
        a puppy or adopt a kitten, we will e-mail you immediately when we know of a local little furry fellow who is
        in need of a new home! </p>

        <h2>Adopt Now</h2>
        <p>Why Adopt a Dog or Cat Over Buying?
<br>Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? 
Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog, puppy, cat or kitten.
Best of all, there are so many benefits when you adopt a dog or adopt a cat over buying. 
For instance, pet adoption will almost always be more affordable than buying a puppy for sale from a breeder or
finding a kitten for sale from a litter. There are more benefits as well. Since pets in rescues and shelters usually
come from a home where the owners ran out of money, got divorced, or had to move, it's common to find that the dogs
and cats on our website are already housetrained, good with kids, or do well with other pets. People are finding out 
that buying a puppy for sale from a breeder isn't all it's cracked up to be and the stress of training a puppy is too
much these days. Best of all, rescues care for their animals, and the dogs and cats don't leave the organization 
without having their shots and being taken to the vet. That means less stress, and more savings! So what are you
waiting for? Go find that perfect pet!</p>

			<h3>Adopt by Age</h3>
			<p>Getting ready to adopt a new puppy? Adopt-a-Pet.com’s “The Puppy Manual” is not a complete
			guide to raising a puppy – there are entire books devoted to that topic! However it is a 
			super-helpful and concise 21 pages covering the basics, to help you prepare for the arrival 
			and first few months with your new puppy.  The basic training, socialization, and guidelines
			explained simply with many easy-to-follow steps can be used starting at the age of 8 weeks, 
			the earliest age at which most people would be bringing a puppy into their home. If your puppy
			is slightly older, as long as they are under 6 months old, these steps can still be helpful! 
			For puppies older than 6 months, many of these tips still apply, but you’ll want to look at 
			the other articles we have in our blog that are for older puppy & dogs too.</p>

			<h3>Adopt by Breed</h3>
			<p>If you're just starting your search, you may be asking yourself what kind of dog or cat 
			would be best for your lifestyle. You may be diligently researching the characteristics of 
			each breed, making a list of which breeds would and wouldn't be a fit. To you, we say: Relax!
			It's okay to do your research, but don't feel like breed selection is the ultimate key to 
			finding your perfect match. It really is about much more than what looks good on paper:	
			it's about the individual dog or cat's personality and the chemistry you feel together 
			(yep, we have chemistry with animals just like we do with other humans!). And don't forget
			about those marvelous mutts! Not only do you get a one-of-a-kind companion, but many 
			veterinarians say that mixed-breed dogs tend to be healthier than purebred dogs, who tend 
			to be prone to certain genetic conditions, depending on the breed. </p>
